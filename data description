## Brief Description of the project and dataset
This project focus on predicting the probability of success of P2P loan application. As online payment and electronic bank become more and
more popular in China, more people are managing their wealth using online platforms. And the development of credit reporting system also 
promote the development of online small amount borrowings. 
This dataset contains 9769 samples from one of the biggest P2P website in China——RenRenDai.

## Variable lists

The explained variable in this model is status. The value of status equals 0 for failure and 1 for success. Null value show that this application
hasn't finished and we don't know the result yet. We remove this part of samples, the remaining samples contain 7493 data points.

y is relatively balanced with 64.51% 1 and 35.49% 0. Overall 64.51% percent of P2P application are successful.

The explaining variable list is relatively long, among them, the most important ones directly related to the cash flow of the contract are:

Target: Total principal money amount of P2P contract. The unit is in RMB.
Interest: Annualized interest rate of the P2P contract. Average interest rate is 14% here which is relatively high.
Maturity: Length of the P2P contract (When will the last cash flow take place) The unit is in month and the average value is about 18 months,
which is one and a half year, which is relatively short.
These three variables can generate "payment"(to be more precise, monthly payment) by using the method of discounting cash flow. But the latter
can't fully embody the characteristics of these three variables.

Other potential explaining variables include demographic information of borrower, credit history and credit certificate:

Age: Average is about 32. Main borrowers are about 30-40.
Income: Monthly income. It is sorted into categories of: below 1000, 1000-2000, 2000-5000, 5000-10000, 10000-20000, 20000-50000, above 50000
Education: Highest education level ever received. It is sorted into categories of: High school, junior college, undergraduate and master.
Workingtime: How long has he been doing current jobs. It is sorted into categories of: below 1 years, 1-3 years, 3-5 years, above 5 years.
Scaleofcompany: The scale of company he or she is now working for, also sorted into categories of: less than 10, 10-100, 100-500, above 500
Marriage: Sorted into categories of: Single, marriage, divorced, widow.
These four category variables above will be analyzed by Ohe method. (Creating correlating dummy variables )

Past success(default): Times of successful(failed) applications.
Certificates: Whether the borrow has past the certificate of certain items: Like identitycertificate, marriagecertificate, incomecertificate,
educatecertificate...
Many variables here so we use PCA method to cut dimensions.


## Sentiment analysis dataset
It is similar with the main variable dataset with two new variables("urgent" and "stable") denoting people's type in the description they submit.
If character "急"(urgent) can be found in description, then the dummy variable of "urgent" equals to 1, otherwise it equals to 0.
If character "稳定" or "良好"(Often followed by "信用"--credit) can be found in description, then dummy variable equals to 1, otherwise it equals to 0.
